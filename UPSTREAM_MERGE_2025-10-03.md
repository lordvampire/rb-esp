**New Features:**
- **Panel Pitch Slider** - Adjust instrument pitch alignment (-64° to +64°)
- **Panel Roll Slider** - Adjust instrument roll alignment (-64° to +64°)
- **Panel Yaw Slider** - Adjust instrument yaw alignment (-64° to +64°)
- **Real-time Attitude Display** - Shows current R/P/T values during adjustment
- **NVS Persistence** - Settings saved to non-volatile storage

**Files Modified:**
- `main/RB/RB02_Setup.c` - Added three sliders with event handlers
- `main/RB/RB02_Config.h` - Added UI elements to RB02_UI struct
- `main/RB/RB02.c` - Added real-time attitude display update

**UI Location:** Settings page → Panel Alignment section

**Usage:**
1. Navigate to Settings page
2. Adjust sliders to compensate for panel mounting angle
3. Settings automatically saved to NVS
4. Calibration applies to all attitude-based instruments

### 2. I2C Debug Functionality
**Source:** Upstream debugging additions

**New Features:**
- `i2c_scan()` function for detecting I2C devices
- Enabled via `RB_DISPLAY_DEBUG` compile flag
- Scans addresses 0x01-0x7F and logs found devices

**Files Modified:**
- `main/main.c` - Added i2c_scan() calls during boot (when RB_DISPLAY_DEBUG defined)

**Boot Output Example:**
```
I (1061) BOOT: Initializing I2C sensors...
I (1161) i2c: I2C scan start
I (1161) i2c: Found device at 0x20  (TCA9554 GPIO expander)
I (1161) i2c: Found device at 0x51  (PCF85063 RTC)
I (1161) i2c: Found device at 0x6B  (QMI8658 IMU)
I (1161) i2c: Found device at 0x76  (BMP280 barometer)
I (1161) i2c: I2C scan done
```

## Merge Conflicts & Fixes

The upstream merge introduced **6 compilation/runtime errors** that were systematically resolved:

### Error 1: Merge Conflict Markers
**Symptom:**
```
error: version control conflict marker in file
main/RB/RB02.c:2693: <<<<<<< HEAD
```

**Root Cause:**
- Git merge conflict not fully resolved
- Conflict markers left in source code

**Fix:** Commit `53bdea1`
- Removed `<<<<<<< HEAD`, `=======`, `>>>>>>> upstream` markers
- Kept v1.3 caching optimization (local change)
- Integrated upstream panel alignment label update
- Both features now working together

**Files Fixed:**
- `main/RB/RB02.c:2693-2731`

---

### Error 2: I2C_MASTER_TIMEOUT_MS Redefinition
**Symptom:**
```
warning: "I2C_MASTER_TIMEOUT_MS" redefined
main/EXIO/TCA9554PWR.h:22: note: this is the location of the previous definition
```

**Root Cause:**
- Macro defined in both `I2C_Driver.h` (2000ms, v1.4) and `TCA9554PWR.h` (1000ms, upstream)
- Conflicting timeout values

**Fix:** Commit `53bdea1`
- Removed definition from `TCA9554PWR.h`
- Added comment referencing `I2C_Driver.h`
- Standardized all I2C operations to 2000ms timeout (v1.4 boot stability)

**Files Fixed:**
- `main/EXIO/TCA9554PWR.h:22`

---

### Error 3: Undeclared SettingStatus2 Variable
**Symptom:**
```
error: 'SettingStatus2' undeclared (first use in this function)
main/RB/RB02.c:2726
```

**Root Cause:**
- Merge conflict resolution accidentally used local variable name
- Should use struct member: `singletonConfig()->ui.SettingStatus2`

**Fix:** Commit `e6ec6f2`
- Changed `lv_label_set_text(SettingStatus2, buf)`
- To `lv_label_set_text(singletonConfig()->ui.SettingStatus2, buf)`

**Files Fixed:**
- `main/RB/RB02.c:2726`

---

### Error 4: Bluetooth Settings Struct Member Access
**Symptom:**
```
error: 'RB02_Status' has no member named 'settingsBluetoothEnabled'
main/RB/Vendor.c:85
```

**Root Cause:**
- Struct member only defined when `RB02_ESP_BLUETOOTH` macro is set
- Unconditional access caused compilation error when Bluetooth disabled

**Fix:** Commit `a973f7f`
- Wrapped access with `#ifdef RB02_ESP_BLUETOOTH` guard
- Matches pattern used elsewhere in codebase

**Files Fixed:**
- `main/RB/Vendor.c:84-86`

**Code:**
```c
#ifdef RB02_ESP_BLUETOOTH
    singletonConfig()->settingsBluetoothEnabled = 0;
#endif
```

---

### Error 5: I2C_MASTER_TIMEOUT_MS Undeclared
**Symptom:**
```
error: 'I2C_MASTER_TIMEOUT_MS' undeclared (first use in this function)
main/EXIO/TCA9554PWR.c:14
main/EXIO/TCA9554PWR.c:26
```

**Root Cause:**
- Removed macro definition from `TCA9554PWR.h` (Error #2 fix)
- But `TCA9554PWR.c` doesn't include `I2C_Driver.h`
- Macro now invisible to implementation file

**Fix:** Commit `a86e239`
- Added `#include "../I2C_Driver/I2C_Driver.h"` to `TCA9554PWR.c`
- Makes 2000ms timeout value available

**Files Fixed:**
- `main/EXIO/TCA9554PWR.c:2`

---

### Error 6: NULL Pointer Crash (Runtime Error)
**Symptom:**
```
Guru Meditation Error: Core 0 panic'ed (LoadProhibited). Exception was unhandled.
PC: 0x42072990 (_lv_obj_get_ext_draw_size)
A2: 0x00000000 (NULL object pointer)
Backtrace: rb_increase_lvgl_tick at RB02.c:2727
```

**Root Cause:**
- Upstream added `panelMountAlignmentLabelHelper` UI element
- Label only created when Settings page is opened (`RB02_Setup_CreateScreen()`)
- Code attempted to update label unconditionally in main loop
- NULL pointer dereference when label doesn't exist (other tabs)

**Fix:** Commit `b3e83e2`
- Added NULL check before `lv_label_set_text()`
- Only updates label if it exists

**Files Fixed:**
- `main/RB/RB02.c:2727-2730`

**Code:**
```c
// v1.4: Only update panel alignment helper label if it exists (created on Settings page)
if (singletonConfig()->ui.panelMountAlignmentLabelHelper != NULL) {
    lv_label_set_text(singletonConfig()->ui.panelMountAlignmentLabelHelper, buf);
}
```

**Impact:**
- **Before:** Immediate crash when opening Settings page
- **After:** Stable operation on all tabs, Settings page fully functional

## Developer Notes

### Merge Strategy Used
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/xiaprojects/rb-esp.git
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
# Manual conflict resolution in RB02.c
# Followed by 6 compilation fixes
```

### Key Architectural Decisions

**1. I2C Timeout Standardization**
- Decision: Use v1.4 timeout (2000ms) for all I2C operations
- Rationale: Boot stability improvements require longer timeouts
- Impact: Overrode upstream 1000ms value in TCA9554PWR.h

**2. Preserve v1.3 Caching**
- Decision: Keep local caching optimization for attitude display
- Rationale: Reduces LVGL updates, improves performance
- Impact: Integrated with upstream real-time display update

**3. NULL Safety for UI Elements**
- Decision: Add NULL checks for conditionally created UI elements
- Rationale: Prevent crashes when UI elements don't exist (other tabs)
- Impact: Stable operation across all workflow tabs

**4. Conditional Bluetooth Compilation**
- Decision: Maintain strict `#ifdef RB02_ESP_BLUETOOTH` guards
- Rationale: Support builds with/without Bluetooth
- Impact: Wrapped all upstream Bluetooth-related struct access

---

## Future Considerations

**Upstream Tracking:**
- Monitor xiaprojects/rb-esp for future updates
- Panel Alignment may receive additional features
- Consider setting up automated merge conflict detection

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test Panel Alignment with actual aircraft mounting angles
- Verify attitude accuracy after alignment adjustment
- GPS testing with external antenna for fix acquisition

**Documentation:**
- User manual update needed for Panel Alignment feature
- Add screenshots of new Settings page sliders
- Document typical aircraft mounting angle ranges
