# RB-Avionics
The RB is the Open-source Aviation instruments suite, the models are divided by CPU/Features. RB-02 will run in ESP32 (Arduino).
- RB-01 -> Display with Synthetic vision, Autopilot and ADSB
- RB-02 -> Display with SixPack (this repo)
- RB-03 -> Display with Autopilot, ADSB, Radio, Flight Computer
- RB-04 -> Display with EMS: Engine monitoring system
- RB-05 -> Display with Stratux BLE Traffic (this repo)

## Community
The RB Avionics is a complete avionics project which is supported by a huge community worldwide, read the Wiki and if you need support join the Discord channel.

## How to
We strongly suggest to install binaries, that are built from building-machine which enrich and check the output.
Anyway if you are brave enough and you are well trained, you can built it yourself by following this procedure:
