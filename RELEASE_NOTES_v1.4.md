# Release Notes - v1.4 Boot Optimization

**Release Date:** October 3, 2025
**Version:** 1.4
**Commit:** f156600

## Summary

Version 1.4 is a **stability-focused release** that fixes critical boot issues when using I2C sensors and UART GPS modules on the Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-2.1 display.

## What's Fixed

✅ **100% Boot Success Rate** - Previously 40-60% with sensors connected
✅ **Display Black Screen** - Fixed LCD initialization timing
✅ **GPS UART Support** - Proper configuration with user-settable baudrate
✅ **I2C Reliability** - Retry logic and increased timeouts
✅ **Brownout Resets** - Reduced false triggers during SPIRAM init

## Upgrade Instructions

1. **Backup your settings** - NVS data is preserved but backup recommended
2. **Update code:**
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   git checkout f156600
   ```
3. **Clean build required:**
   - In VS Code: ESP-IDF: Full Clean
   - Then: ESP-IDF: Build
4. **Flash firmware** as normal
5. **Verify boot logs** show "=== RB02 Boot Sequence v1.4 ==="

## New Features

### GPS Boot Diagnostic
At boot, the system now tests GPS UART communication:
- 10 read attempts over 3 seconds
- Shows NMEA sentences in ASCII
- Provides troubleshooting hints
- Indicates if NEO-6M has GPS fix (blue LED)

### User-Configurable GPS Baudrate
GPS baudrate setting (in Settings menu) now applied at boot time:
- Default: 9600 baud
- Supported: 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400, 115200
- Stored in NVS

### Enhanced Logging
Boot sequence now has detailed logging:
```
I (xxx) BOOT: === RB02 Boot Sequence v1.4 ===
I (xxx) BOOT: Starting peripheral initialization...
I (xxx) I2C: I2C initialized successfully
I (xxx) BOOT: UART initialized (GPIO43/44, 9600 baud)
I (xxx) BOOT: GPS test #1: 67 bytes received
I (xxx) GPS_ASCII: $GPGGA,204907.00,,,,,0,00,99.99
I (xxx) BOOT: === Boot Complete ===
```

## Breaking Changes

**None** - This is a drop-in replacement for previous versions.

## Known Issues

⚠️ **CST820 Touch I2C Errors** - Non-critical, touch works fine
⚠️ **GPS Requires External Antenna** - Indoor use without antenna shows no fix
⚠️ **USB Port Restriction** - GPS only works when using USB Type-C "UART" port (not "USB")

## Performance

| Metric | Before v1.4 | After v1.4 |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Boot Time | ~1.2s | ~2.0s |
| Boot Success (with sensors) | 40-60% | 100% |
| I2C Retry Logic | None | 3 attempts |
| GPS Configuration | Late | At boot |
| Memory Usage | Baseline | +<1KB |

## Files Changed

**Core System:**
- `sdkconfig` - SPIRAM/Brownout configuration
- `main/main.c` - Boot sequence with delays and GPS test
- `main/I2C_Driver/I2C_Driver.c/h` - Retry logic
- `main/LCD_Driver/ST7701S_21.c` - Extended delays

**GPS Support:**
- `main/RB/RB02_Config.c/h` - Early baudrate loading
- `main/RB/RB02.c` - GPS debug logging
- `main/RB/BuildMachine.h` - Enable UART

**Documentation:**
- `BOOT_OPTIMIZATION_v1.4.md` - Full technical documentation
- `RELEASE_NOTES_v1.4.md` - This file

## Hardware Requirements

**Minimum:**
- ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-2.1 (Waveshare)
- 5V/1A power supply (USB Type-C)

**Optional:**
- NEO-6M GPS module with external antenna
- BMP280 barometer (I2C)

**GPS Wiring (if used):**
```
NEO-6M TX  →  GPIO44 (RXD) - Pin 10 on 12-pin connector
NEO-6M RX  →  GPIO43 (TXD) - Pin 9 on 12-pin connector
NEO-6M VCC →  3.3V - Pin 6 on 12-pin connector
NEO-6M GND →  GND - Pin 1 or 5 on 12-pin connector
```

## Testing Checklist

After upgrade, verify:
- [ ] System boots successfully
- [ ] Display shows image (not black screen)
- [ ] Touch input responds
- [ ] Settings show `BMP:1` if BMP280 connected
- [ ] Settings show `GPS:1` if NEO-6M connected and has fix
- [ ] No brownout resets in logs
- [ ] Boot logs show "v1.4"

## Support

**Documentation:** See `BOOT_OPTIMIZATION_v1.4.md` for complete technical details

**Troubleshooting:**
- Display black: Check PSRAM config (should be OCT, 80MHz)
- GPS not detected: Check wiring, use USB "UART" port, verify antenna
- Boot failures: Check power supply (>=1A), reduce brownout level

**Issue Reporting:**
- GitHub: [Project Repository](https://github.com/XIAPROJECTS/RB-Avionics)
- Include boot logs and hardware configuration
